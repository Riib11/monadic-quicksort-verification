## Existential Type Constraint Bug

There is a bug with qualifying an existential type variable with a typeclass
constraint e.g.

```haskell
data R m = R {r :: forall a. Eq a => a -> m a}
```

This typechecks on the online liquid demo (see here:
https://liquidhaskell.slack.com/archives/C54QAL9RR/p1614785461049900), but
causes a permalink export error somehow (not sure what's up with that).

## Applicative Transitivity for Propositional Equality

```haskell
pf_1_2 pf_2_3

pf_1_3 transitivity' 3 (pf 3 $ ... ) transitivity 1 2 3 pf_1_2 pf_2_3

x =$= (y, pf_x_y) =*= (z, pf_y_z)

---

y ~? pf_y_z = (y, pf_y_z)

x =$= (y, pf_x_y) = (x, z pf_y_z -> transitivity x y z pf_x_y pf_y_z)

(x, k) =*= (z, pf_y_z) = (x, w pf_z_w -> transitivity x z w (k z pf_y_z)
pf_z_w)

(x, k) *** (y, pf_x_y) = k y pf_x_y
```

## Why not Type-Indexed Equality in Liquid Haskell

I asked Niki about why there is no refinement-level type-indexed equality in LH.
The main reasons are:

1. If explicit types could be mentioned within refinements, then those types
   would be refined (even if by `True`). This allowed refinements within
   refinements, which leads to inconsistencies. It also doesnt seem to make
   sense to require a specific check for trivial refinements.
2. The standard SMT library interface does not provide extensionality
