# Meeting 2021-03-24

## Progress

- test if `eqprop = (=)` introduces unsoundness (this could be a really useful
  result)
  - two approaches for defining axioms:
    - GADT
    - assume
  - seems to work so far! doesn't fall for the obvious errors that positing
    `funext` does
  - needs more testing, to see if accepts/rejects all the right things
  - why does this work?
  - could there potentially be issues with higher-order equalities that Z3
    handles differently from CVC4? Michael noted that this is possible, though i
    havent found concrete examples so far
  - demonstrate
- issue: allow declaring local refinement liftings

## TODO

- [ ] look into how LEAN handles prop equality
  - appears to just provide a direct interface for translating datatypes to SMT
    expressions, and proof search tactics

## Notes

Using `eqprop = (=)` naÃ¯vely is definitely unsound, even with the soft
type-indexing of equality via `EqualProp a {x} {y}`. The problem is that when
`f = g` is established via extensionality, the domains of `f` and `g` are
forgotten, and `f` is substituted for `g` even in places where the domain makes
the use of `f` or `g` invalid on the substituted domain. For example, the
following false `lem` can be derived.

```haskell
-- using `=` instead of `eqprop`
{-@
type EqualProp a X Y = {w:EqualityProp a | X = Y}
@-}

...

{-@ reflect f @-}
f :: Int -> Int
f x = x

{-@ reflect g @-}
g :: Int -> Int
g x = if 0 <= v then f x else 0

{-@
lem ::
  EqualProp ({v:Int | 0 <= v} -> Int) {f} {g} ->
  x:Int -> EqualProp Int {f x} {g x}
@-}
lem :: EqualityProp (Int -> Int) -> Int -> EqualityProp Int
lem pf x = reflexivity (f x)
```

This is because, when given the term
`pf :: EqualProp ({v:Int | 0 <= v} -> Int) {f} {g}`, the fact `f = g` is added
to the refinement space without the domain information about `f` and `g`. Then
`f x = g x` is derived by substituting `f` for `g` to get `g x = g x`, which is
trivially true via reflexivity.

Extensional equality is to say

> `f :: a -> b` is extensionally equal to `g :: a -> b` iff for all `x :: a`, we
> have `f x = g x`.

But with refinement involved, we must take into account that `f` and `g` may
have compatible domains that are not strictly equal, which are not accounted for
in the equality, since the equality is not (and cannot be) type-indexed. We can
still generalize the extensional equality _over_ refinements as follows:

> `f :: a<p> -> b` is extensionally equal to `g :: a<p> -> b` iff for all
> `q :: a -> Bool` and for all `x :: a<q>` -- i.e.
> `forall <q :: a -> Bool>. x:a<q>` -- we have `f x = g x`.

The implementation of this is problematic because:

1. in LH it is impossible to _extract_ the refinements of the domains of `f` and
   `g` as `p`, in order to use the unrefined `a` later as the domain of `x`. it
   is also impossible\* to _erase_ the refinement of `a` in order to apply just
   the predicate `q` as in `x :: a<q>`
2. when checking `f x = g x`, there is a refinement type mismatch because `a<q>`
   may not be a subtype of `a<p>` which is the domain of `f` and `g`. This
   problem persists even when you substitute `a` for `a<p>` as the type of `x`,
   since `a` is really just `a<\_ -> True>` which is not a subtype of, say,
   `a<\x -> 0 <= x>` since `True` does not imply `0 <= x`.

(\* maybe this is possible somehow with typeclasses? some refinement-level
action happens when a type is constrained by a type-class, that dictates that
the type must be unrefined, perhaps??)
