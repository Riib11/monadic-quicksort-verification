- Use `r a <re x y>` to properly use abstract refinements. Will this work to
  make my code typecheck?

- Its ok to fall into the abstract rabbithole that I've been working in -- it
  will lead to interseting results and is more useful than the shallow work of
  implementing the monadic quicksort proof

- perhaps we will get to talk to the other people that worked on the
  propositional equality for LH paper.
