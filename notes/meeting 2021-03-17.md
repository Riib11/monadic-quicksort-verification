## Dealing with Lambdas in refinements

it seems that LH is very sensitive about two things relating to lambdas:

- cannot reason about directly applying a lambda -- you must use
  `apply (\x -> x)` rather than `\x -> x`
- cannot reason about relationship between partially applied functions i.e.
  can't use `apply f = apply g`

This causes some annoyances, for example here where I have to explicitly
instantiate many uses of `apply ...`:

```haskell
ep_t4_t5 =
  substitutability
    (apply (\j -> write ary i x >> (writeList ary (S i) xs >> writeList ary j ys)))
    (S i `add` length xs)
    (S (i `add` length xs))
    ( reflexivity $
        S i `add` length xs
          ? S (i `add` length xs)
    )
    ? apply (\j -> write ary i x >> (writeList ary (S i) xs >> writeList ary j ys)) (S i `add` length xs)
    ? apply (\j -> write ary i x >> (writeList ary (S i) xs >> writeList ary j ys)) (S (i `add` length xs))
```
