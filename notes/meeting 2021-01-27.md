## Ideas for defining monadic equality

- type family for instances of equality for equality
  - generalize method (or implementation) of equality for typeclasses?
  - can make use of "heirarchical" organization of typeclasses when using then
    without actual Haskell typeclasses (i.e. representing typeclasses as
    datatypes)
- build off of Niki's diagram, for heirarchy of equality
  - need a parellel of `AEq` that is specific to monads?
  - include base case for nested monad term as well as nested `PEq` term:
    - `EqMB_lift_base : ... PEq a {x} {y} ... EqMB m a {m x} {m y}`
    - `EqMB_lift_ind : ... EqMB a x y ... EqMB m a {lift x} {lift y}`
  - use LH equality, but parametrize by "run" function
    `run : Monad m, Eq b => m a -> b`, so that monadic equality is just
    `meq m1 m2 = run m1 == run m2`.

## Examples to Prove

- prove that `Id` and `Reader (() -> a)` are equal monads?
  - but this is equality of moand _types_, not monad _terms_ (which is what we
    want for monadic quicksort paper)
- associativity of `seq` i.e. `m1 >> (m2 >> m3) ==Monad (m1 >> m2) >> m3`
