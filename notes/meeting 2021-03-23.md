# Meeting 2021-03-23

## Progress

- test if `eqprop = (=)` introduces unsoundness (this could be a really useful
  result)
  - two approaches for defining axioms:
    - GADT
    - assume
  - seems to work so far! doesn't fall for the obvious errors that positing
    `funext` does
  - needs more testing, to see if accepts/rejects all the right things
  - why does this work?
  - could there potentially be issues with higher-order equalities that Z3
    handles differently from CVC4? Michael noted that this is possible, though i
    havent found concrete examples so far
  - demonstrate
- issue: allow declaring local refinement liftings

## TODO

- [ ] see if i can do the automatic expansion of infixed transutils
  - this is uneeded if `eqprop = (=)` works
- [ ] look into how LEAN handles prop equality
  - appears to just provide a direct interface for translating datatypes to SMT
    expressions, and proof search tactics
